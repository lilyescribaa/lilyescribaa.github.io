    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Lily Escriba. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island and am a undeclared major. I am from Middlesex County, New Jersey. </p>

    <p>I enjoy going to the beach with my friends, listening to music, traveling new places, and going on hikes. My favorite artist are Drake and Bruno Mars. My favorite memory of this past summer of 2023 was going Point Pleaseant with family and friends. We played mini golf after a long day at the beach and would go to the bar and grill and have pina colodas. </p>
